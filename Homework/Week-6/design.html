            <p1> I started my visualiation by trying to find the right dataset. I used the 'Happy Planet Index' before and found it's data and the story behind the data very usefull and interesting. Therefore, I decided to make my linkedview visualisation about the HPI. <br></p1>
            <p2><br> My first step was making the scatterplot. To make the scatterplot I had to choose between all the different variables the HPI gives. Finally, I decided to use the Average life expectancy and the Happy life years. I wanted my scatterplot to show a big variaty of data and show the differences between countries. When looking at these two variables the differences between coutnries is big which makes the scatterplot look interesting and diverse. <br><p2>
            <p3><br>After fininshing my scatterplot I focused on adding a worldmap. The visualisation on the HPI webpage is so easy to interprate and understand that I wanted to do the same for my own webpage. Therefore, I implemented a worldmap and colored it according to the Happy planet index. Red meaning a low HPI and Green a high HPI. This makes it easy to see which countries are doing well on the HPI and which arent. The countries without data I left grey. <br><p3>
              <p4><br> The next challenge was linking the map with my scatterplot. When hovering over and selecting a country by clickin on it you will automaticly be directed to the right 'dot' in my scatterplot that matches the chosen country. This way it is easy to get and read more information about the chosen country and see how well it is doing focussing on the happy life years and Average life expectancy. <br><p4>
